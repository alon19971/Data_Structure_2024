# Java Data Structures

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository! I am a second-year Software Practical Engineering student specializing in the Java programming language. This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing various data structures essential for efficient problem-solving and application development in Java.

## About Me
As a student deeply interested in the intricacies of software development, I have chosen to focus on the Java language due to its versatility and wide usage in the industry. Through this repository, I aim to explore and document my journey learning about different data structures, understanding their applications, and implementing them in Java.

## Data Structures in Java
This section of the repository will cover various data structures, showcasing how each can be utilized in Java programming. Here are a few of the data structures I will explore:
- **Arrays and ArrayLists**: Managing collections of items in a linear format.
- **Stacks**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data management.
- **Queues**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data handling.
- **Linked Lists**: Elements linked using pointers, allowing dynamic data management.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical tree structures, such as binary search trees.
- **Hash Maps**: Key-value pairs for efficient data retrieval.

Each data structure has its specific use-cases and benefits, which I will delve into within this repository.

## Learning Objectives
- **Understanding** the fundamental concepts of various data structures.
- **Implementing** these structures in Java to see how they work in practice.
- **Comparing** the performance of different data structures in various scenarios.
