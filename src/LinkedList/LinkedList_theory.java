        //              Nodes are in non-consecutive memory locations, elements are linked using pointers.
        //              The list has a link to the first container,
        //              and each container has a link to the next container in the list.
        //              can be used as a Stack or a Queue (LIFO or FIFO system).
        //              indexes is starts from 0 (like an array)

        // Advantages:
        // 1. Dynamic data structure (allocates needed memory while running)
        // 2. Insertion and deletion of nodes is easy. O(1)
        // 3. Low memory waste.

        // ArrayList used for STORING and ACCESSING data.
        // LinkedList used to MANIPULATE data.
